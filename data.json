There is also projects presented that are made in my spare time. While working on this project I learned about HTTP, REST-API, docker and kubernetes and basic website design.",

        "long_description": "A 2D space invaders inspired game that lets you take control of a ladybug using the arrow keys and spacebar to fire your projectiles. The ladybug was in the middle of it's summer vacation when she is met by horrifying unknown bugs of various types that makes it clear that you are their next meal. Your goal is to eliminate these bugs while dodging acidic projectiles and camouflaged spiders. For each bug you defeat you gather points. The faster you do this the more points will be rewarded. Compare your best score through a leaderboard and challenge your friends. Can you survive the bug invasion? While working on this project I have gain knowledge of object-oriented programming and principles using C++. The focus of this project was working with classdesign, inheritance, polymorphism and pointers. We had to design our own game engine and state stack to change between the different states of the game. The development environment we used was mainly cmake, make, clion, sfml and basic game design in general. The experience has been very educational to be a part of a project through the entire development cycle, by writing our own requirements- and designspecification, and soon after realize the design in code and all this on a tight deadline.

Dopo supports statements for selection, repetition and mathematical arithmetic. There is a inbuilt standard-library with functions meant for the string- and list-datatype. Dopo is using a recursive descent parser for its lexing and parsing stage. After that process is complete there will be a tree of nodes representing the constructs the user has typed throughout the code. Each construct is its own class and will after be executed individually until it reaches the top of the tree. Dopo is programmed using object-oriented principles in the programming language Ruby and tested with unittest framework." ,

    "long_description": "The purpose of the Konkarong app is for a user to be able to post listings about something that has disappeared or stolen. It could be a person, a pet, a bicycle and so on. Each listing contains information on the following aspects: 1-3 images, a title,  a description, an upload date, an end date,  which address the advertised last was seen picked using google maps, which category the listing belongs to and contact information for the owner of the ad (email, phone number or both). Each user has an account linked to it which can be created via email and password, Google sign in or Facebook login. An account is required to be able to use the app's functionality. After a user has logged in it can then put up listings (max 20), search for listings and favorite the ones he/she wants to store (max 20). The user can see a list of their own posted listings as well as those they have favorite marked. After successfully placing the listing, the owner can choose to edit it with a new one information and then re-upload it or delete it in its entirety. There is also a profile page where only the user has access to information about profile picture, number of listings posted, number of favorite tagged listings and when the account was created. There is also the opportunity for users to contact those responsible in creating Konkarong via a link to email apps to give someone form of help desk support. The search takes place via free text where the user can specify the category and city and sort by the number of favorite markings, newest listings first or oldest first. After a search, relevant listings will appear presented in the form of smaller clickable cards that redirect the user to a page that gets complete information about the listings. The idea is that if a user identifies an advertised item can choose to contact the listing owner by phone or email depending on the listing owner's chosen contact information. Konkarong then provides an opportunity for users to spread the word about the lost as well Konkarong is thus aimed at people who want to contribute with more solidarity in everyday life." ,
