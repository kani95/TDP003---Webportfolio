The frontend created using HTML, CSS and bootstrap. The purpose of this webportfolio is to present projects that are made during the Innovative programming program at Link√∂ping University. There is also projects presented that are made in my spare time. While working on this project I learned about HTTP, REST-API, docker and kubernetes and basic website design.",

        "long_description": "A 2D space invaders inspired game that lets you take control of a ladybug using the arrow keys and spacebar to fire your projectiles. The ladybug was in the middle of it's summer vacation when she is met by horrifying unknown bugs of various types that makes it clear that you are their next meal. Your goal is to eliminate these bugs while dodging acidic projectiles and camouflaged spiders. For each bug you defeat you gather points. The faster you do this the more points will be rewarded. Compare your best score through a leaderboard and challenge your friends. Can you survive the bug invasion? While working on this project I have gain knowledge of object-oriented programming and principles using C++. The focus of this project was working with classdesign, inheritance, polymorphism and pointers. We had to design our own game engine and state stack to change between the different states of the game. The development environment we used was mainly cmake, make, clion, sfml and basic game design in general. The experience has been very educational to be a part of a project through the entire development cycle, by writing our own requirements- and designspecification, and soon after realize the design in code and all this on a tight deadline.

Dopo allows users to create basic datatypes such as integers, floats, booleans and strings, aswell as more complicated datatypes such as hashmaps and arrays. Dopo supports statements for selection, repetition and mathematical arithmetic. There is a inbuilt standard-library with functions meant for the string- and list-datatype. Dopo is using a recursive descent parser for its lexing and parsing stage. After that process is complete there will be a tree of nodes representing the constructs the user has typed throughout the code. Each construct is its own class and will after be executed individually until it reaches the top of the tree. Dopo is programmed using object-oriented principles in the programming language Ruby and tested with unittest framework." ,
